Welcome to DDSIM's documentation!
================================

A tool for quantum circuit simulation by the Institute for Integrated Circuits at the Johannes Kepler University Linz.

The tool builds upon our quantum functionality representation (QFR) which in turns builds on our decision diagram (DD) package.

For more information, on our work on quantum circuit simulation please visit iic.jku.at/eda/research/quantum_simulation or, for more information on our work on noise-aware quantum circuit simulation, please visit iic.jku.at/eda/research/noise_aware_simulation.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us via iic-quantum@jku.at or by creating an issue on GitHub.
