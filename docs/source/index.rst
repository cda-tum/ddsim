Welcome to MQT DDSIM's documentation!
=================================

A tool for quantum circuit simulation by the `Chair for Design Automation <https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/>`_ at the `Technical University of Munich <https://www.tum.de/>`_.
DDSIM is part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT; formerly known as JKQ and developed by the `Institute for Integrated Circuits <https://iic.jku.at/eda/>`_ at the `Johannes Kepler University Linz <https://jku.at>`_).
It builds upon [MQT Core](https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-core) which provides handling for quantum circuits and decision diagrams.

For more information, on our work on quantum circuit simulation please visit `www.cda.cit.tum.de/research/quantum_simulation <https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/research/quantum_simulation>`_ or, for more information on our work on noise-aware quantum circuit simulation, please visit `www.cda.cit.tum.de/research/noise_aware_simulation <https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/research/noise_aware_simulation/>`_.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us via quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de or by creating an `issue <https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-ddsim/issues>`_ on GitHub.
